=Intro=
After some learning of Objective C/C++ i've done a quick port to iOS.
It uses GLESv2 renderer and OpenAL audio.

Here is a testing version for iPad's (3 and higher) - see issue 49.

Note: there is "True Speed" option like in desktop version. If you really want smooth scrollers on 60Hz iPad screen, you can disable "True Speed" option. But the sound will be ~20% faster.

=Installation=
 * Jailbreak your device.
 * Unpack it to /Applications folder on device (under root user).
 * Run 'uicache' under 'mobile' user.
 * Place ROMs to /User/Documents folder (for 'mobile' user).
 * Enjoy!

=Controls=
Tap left-upper corner for menu.
Tap right-upper corner for onscreen keyboard/joystick toggle.
